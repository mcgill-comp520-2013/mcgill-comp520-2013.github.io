At this point in time you should:
<p>

<ul>
<li>have implemented the WIG scanner; note that the scanner
      probably <a href="WIGscanparse_lexer_states.html">has to have
      multiple states</a> in order to avoid "keyword stealing"

<li>have implemented the WIG parser;

<li>have implemented the construction of WIG abstract syntax trees;

<li>have implemented the WIG weeder; and

<li>have implemented the WIG pretty printer; and

<li>have tested your implementation, by using your pretty printer to
test acceptance of existing benchmarks, and by using your weeder to
test rejection of micro benchmarks that you write.
</ul>
<p>

Checklist:
<ul> 
<li>have you handled HTML correctly, including META tags?
<p>

<li>does your scanner/parser run on <a href="../wig/examples/">these
benchmarks</a>?  What about
the <a href="../benchmarks/2004/wig/">2004<a/>,
<a href="../benchmarks/2007/wig/">2007<a/>, and
<a href="../benchmarks/2008/wig/">2008<a/> class WIG benchmarks?
<p>

<li>does <code>pretty(parse(pretty(parse(X)))) =
pretty(parse(X))</code> for these benchmarks?
<p>

<li>does the output of the pretty printer compile on the
<code>wig4</code>, <code>wig10</code>, <code>wig18</code>,
<code>pwig</code>, or <code>lkwig</code> compilers for each of these
benchmarks?  For the cases where it does not compile, is the original
benchmark also rejected?
<p>

<li>have you created a suite of tiny <code>.wig</code> programs that
are correctly rejected by your weeder?
<p>

<li>does your compiler have a friendly command-line interface with
built-in documentation of useful switches, either available by default
when no arguments are given or via the standard <code>--help</code>
switch?  Can you do a better job than the <code>lkwig</code> compiler
in this regard?
<p>

<li>do you have a GNU Make <code>Makefile</code> or Ant <code>build.xml</code> with the following targets:
<p>
<ul>
<li><code>all</code> (default, builds and tests);
<li><code>code</code> (builds);
<li><code>check</code> (tests, simply depending on <code>weed</code>, <code>pretty</code>, and <code>unit</code> for now);
<li><code>weed</code> (tests weeder);
<li><code>pretty</code> (tests pretty printer); and
<li><code>unit</code> (tests individual functions through unit testing, at least where constructing the input is straightforward)?
</ul>
<p>
If you are developing a C program and decide you want to use the <a
href="http://www-src.lip6.fr/homepages/Alexandre.Duret-Lutz/autotools.html">GNU
Autotools</a> and <a href="http://check.sourceforge.net">Check</a> for
your build system that is most excellent.
<p>
</ul>

You should check in your source code to <code>group-X/wig/src</code>.
You should also detail your progress for each of the steps above in
<code>group-X/reports/scanparse.txt</code>.  Remember that if you
write your milestone report well enough then you can likely reuse
portions of it in your final project report.
<p>

This milestone is due on the Friday of Week 7.  It will count for 5%
of your grade.  Marks will be generously deducted for late
submissions.  It will not be considered complete until you can
truthfully answer yes to all questions.  This is a fairly considerable
milestone and you will not be able to finish it in one day.  Remember
that successfully completing the milestones is a key factor in
completing the WIG project, and that timely completion of milestones
is part of the grade for the course.  Also remember that we expect to
see all group members committing changes to the Subversion repository.
