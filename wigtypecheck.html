At this point in time you should:
<ul>
<li>have defined the types relevant for WIG programs
<li>have specified a set of type rules for WIG programs
<li>have implemented the corresponding check for static type correctness;
and
<li>have tested your implementation, by:
<ol>
<li>extending the pretty printer to print the type of every expression;
<li>writing test programs that provoke every error message; and
<li>making sure your compiler handles the benchmarks
</ol>
<li> have added a command-line switch that enables (or disables) the type checking phase;
<li> have added a command-line switch that enables (or
disables) the printing of expression types in the pretty printer

<p>
You should detail your progress for each of the steps above in
<code>group-X/reports/typecheck.txt</code>.  Remember that if you
write your milestone report well enough then you can likely reuse
portions of it in your final project report.
