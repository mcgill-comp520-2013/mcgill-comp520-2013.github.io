Good news everyone, this is the last assignment :)

So it's about code generation, but also polishing your compiler up.

Remember that you are free to use any target language for the code generation

We expect at the end a complete and usable compiler :
<ul>
    <li> it sould works on all the benchmarks provided, 
    or provide meaningfull error messages.</li>
    <li>it should be easy to use (--help , build system..etc..) and intuitive.</li>
    <li>you should provide scripts or something (either built in the compiler or 
    outside of it), to make the compiler easy to test. (for example: a script
    which runs all the benchmark and check the expected result (following UNIX 
    return value convention).</li>
</ul>

Really important also, you should write a *complete* report. We provide you
a template of what we expect in it <a href="http://www.github.com/mcgill-comp520-2013/mcgill-comp520-2013.github.io/tree/master/wigreport">in the repo</a>
(note that you can write your report with whatever software you prefer. At the end we just want a PDF).
It should clearly describe all the phases, the input, the ouput, when are the error
messages triggedered ..etc..
We expect something in the range of 20 to 30 pages. (depending on how many tricks you use
to make it longer with font size and interlines ..)
