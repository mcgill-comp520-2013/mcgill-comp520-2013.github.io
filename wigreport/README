This directory contains all the files you need to make a latex wig
report.  You may use a different text formatting system, but you must
follow the sections as in this report.

If you do want to use latex, there is a Makefile that will create .ps
and .pdf files.  You can find a nice introduction on using latex in
the file latex.ps.  There are many other documents available via the
web about LaTeX use, and your TA and instructor are also quite familiar.

LaTeX documents are source code too, so you should be using Subversion
to manage them.
