At this point in time you should:
<ul>
<li> have defined the kinds of identifiers that occur in WIG programs;
<li> have decided what symbol information is relevant to each kind;
<li> have implemented the construction of symbol tables; 
<li> have implemented the analysis of identifier uses;
<li> have tested your implementation, by:
<ol>
<li>printing out a symbol table for
a representative program and comparing it to a manual construction;
<li>writing test programs that provoke every error message; and
<li>making sure your compiler handles either <a

</ol>
<li> have added a command-line switch that enables (or disables) the symbol table phase;
</ul>
<p>
You should also detail your progress for each of the steps above in
<code>group-X/reports/symbol.txt</code>.  Remember that if you
write your milestone report well enough then you can likely reuse
portions of it in your final project report.
