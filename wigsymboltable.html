At this point in time you should:
<ul>
<li> have defined the kinds of identifiers that occur in WIG programs;
<li> have decided what symbol information is relevant to each kind;
<li> have defined the appropriate <code>SYMBOL</code> (C) or
<code>Symbol</code> (Java) type;
<li> have implemented the construction of symbol tables; 
<li> have implemented the analysis of identifier uses;
<li> have tested your implementation, by:
<ol>
<li>printing out a symbol table for
a representative program and comparing it to a manual construction;
<li>writing test programs that provoke every error message; and
<li>making sure your compiler handles either <a
href="../wig/examples/">these old examples</a> and the <a
href="../benchmarks/2009/">2009 class benchmarks</a> (previous years
  are important, but not critical like 2009) or prints an error
message if not;
</ol>
<li> have added a command-line switch that enables (or disables) the symbol table phase;
and
<li> have added a <code>symbol</code> target to your
<code>Makefile</code> or <code>build.xml</code> for
testing the symbol table.
</ul>
<p>
You should check in your source code to <code>group-X/wig/src</code>.
You should also detail your progress for each of the steps above in
<code>group-X/reports/symbol.txt</code>.  Remember that if you
write your milestone report well enough then you can likely reuse
portions of it in your final project report.
<p>

This milestone is due on the Friday of Week 8.  It will count for 5%
of your grade.  Marks will be generously deducted for late
submissions.  It will not be considered complete until you have
completed all of these tasks.  This is a fairly considerable milestone
and you will not be able to finish it in one day.  Remember that
successfully completing the milestones is a key factor in completing
the WIG project, and that timely completion of milestones is part of
the grade for the course.  Also remember that we expect to see all
group members committing changes to the Subversion repository.
