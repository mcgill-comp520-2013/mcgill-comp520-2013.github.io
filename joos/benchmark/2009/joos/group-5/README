Our benchmark is called Beep.  What it does is filter text for swear words
defined in Lexicon.java and replaces them with less vulgar, and hopefully
amusing words or terms.  You may wonder why the program name is Beep, but
hopefully after you run it you'll understand.  If you are using Ubuntu on the
lab machines, there is a terminal and a virtual terminal, please use the 
non-virtual one.  

If you want to use our run script, you will have to add the 'jus' script from 
the group-5/bin/ directory to your $JOOSDIR/bin/ directory, which should be in 
your path.  Our joos program should also be in your path as well.  The script 
is written in bash, so please make sure you are running that as well.

./run

should do everything for you, including compiling with joos, jasmin, and 
finally running with java.  Note that java should also be in your path, and we 
didn't really bother with the $JAVADIR stuff.  Don't mind all the excess 
messages from the output, it just makes us feel better when things work.

If you were wondering, the input text is the "Uncle Fucker" song from the South
Park movie.

Enjoy.
