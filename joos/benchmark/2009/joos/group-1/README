JOOS Benchmark
Group 1

Our benchmark reads in a PNG image and outputs an HTML page with both a colored 
and uncolored ASCII image.  It automatically scales the output so that the 
longest edge is 150 characters.

The image to ASCII conversion is done by first creating a temporary greyscale 
image, and then with that we pick an appropriate character using the intensity 
at each pixel.  The colored version wraps each character in a SPAN tag and 
applies the proper color property using the RGB value of the associated pixel.

Steps for compiling:
1. # javac ./lib/*.java
2. # joosc Main.java JoosImage.java ExternLibs.joos
