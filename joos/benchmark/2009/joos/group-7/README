To run:

If joosc is working then:

  $ make run

Should compile and run the program in interactive mode.

  $ make runFile

Should compile and run the file straight from inl. Redirect at will.

To use Java:
  
 $ make runJava / runJavaFile

Running 

 $ make all 
or
 $ make java

Will build the code using joosc, javac resepectively. Can run with ./run, ./run2 if you want to use inl.

Commands are:
look
get
move
inventory
what (not really functional yet)


------ 
Engine wise pretty much everything is in place but due to
fights with joos the content itself is somewhat subdued which is sad
as right now adding commands, locations, triggers, etc. is really
simple. That's why the story will be continued! As it is, I think it
is a pretty solid benchmark as it has a lot of subclassing and class
interactions, and passing as arguments, going around.


TO DO: 

   To have fun commands

   More places and the real, funny, story.
