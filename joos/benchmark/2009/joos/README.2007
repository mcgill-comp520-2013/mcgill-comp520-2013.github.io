Hi,

Several comments about getting the scripts to work:

1) You must follow the directions in public_html/howtojoosjava.html
before beginning.  You will note that these tell you joosa- is a
wrapper script that expects to find a binary called "joos" on your
PATH.  This should now point to your peephole joos directory.

2) The group-3 input/output appears to be a little wacky, I'm looking
at it.

3) Peng's instructions tell you all you really need to know about how
to use the scripts.

4) I moved the README file to README.2004 and created a new
README.2007.  README.2004 still contains mostly useful information,
but the references to the environment are outdated.  However, Peng has
not significantly edited the scripts, and in particular the note about
getting the group 08 benchmark from 2004 to work should apply, as
should the various examples about how to debug things, use '2>&1 |
tee', etc.

5) Run svn up; svn log -v | less in public_html, refresh web pages,
and try again if you are having problems before emailing.  So far I
have not changed anything really significant, but have tried to make
information easier to find.

They work for me, so they should also work for you if you've set
things up per the instructions.

==================

Peng has written new directions.  They are in
../howtopeepholeopt.html.  Let us know if you encounter problems.  You
need to have comments, increments, and for-loops working in your A-
compiler for the benchmarks to compile.
