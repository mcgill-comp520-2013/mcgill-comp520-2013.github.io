java Main < in1 > out1

Main will start a game of Pong. The input is described by the program and
hopefully self explanatory. If you don't find infinite loops funny don't try
another wall then the stone wall. We had those others walls working (with
modified slopes) but somehow it broke at the end. Anyways, if you play Pong
with the stone wall it should work fine. Have fun!
