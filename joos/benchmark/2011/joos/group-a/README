Game of Life 
Authors: Rafik Draoui and Vincent Magnoux

An implementation of Conway's Game of Life 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)


Input
-----
The first line of the input determines the board size. The second
determines the number of generations to generate. The rest of the file
should be a representation of board as the initial configuration. Dots
('.') represents dead cells and zeros ('0') live cells. 


Output
------
The board configuration is printed to stdout at each generation. For a
better visual result, it is recommended that the size of the terminal
window should be 2 pixels more than the board size. For example, a
standard 80x24 terminal window is well-suited for displaying boards of
size 22.
