# This file takes as input any number of joos or java source files.
# It will then compile them with joosa- and joosa+. It will also,
# for the first file passed as input, move the compiled .j output 
# of joosa- to $fname.j.mine, and will move the compiled .j output 
# of joosa+ to $fname.j.theirs. It will then diff the two files,
# and store the resulting (possibly empty) diff in $fname.result.
# Finally, it will print out the file name and state success or
# failure based on whether the diff returned true.
