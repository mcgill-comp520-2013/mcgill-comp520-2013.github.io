WIG Report Generator

This program accepts a TeX file as input. It then replaces all text inside
subsections (\subsection) with artificial sentences. Results may be hilarious,
you have been warned.

Our included input file allows us to produce a full WIG report. The resulting 
LateX code can be used with the Makefile in public_html/wigreport for cs520 to
produce a beautiful WIG report in pdf format.
