We design a Happy Farm game.
There are a dog and a cat on the farm, and we have limited food.There are 
water, fishes and bones. 
A player plays the role of a farmer. The farmer has limited energy. The farmer
can choose to play with the animals or to feed them with different kinds of 
food. Feeding foods or playing contributes differently to the final score 
depending on whether animals are happy about it. Also, different work takes 
different amount of energy from the farmer. When the farmer is too tired, he will
be judged according to his work.

How to Play:

The farmer can choose to deal with cat or dog by typing "cat" or "dog" at any
time.
The farmer can choose to play with or feed the animal selected by typing "play"
or "feed". After typing "feed", the farmer can choose which food by typing the
names as "fish","water" and "bone".

Have fun on the Happy Farm and remember to be a diligent and smart farmer!
